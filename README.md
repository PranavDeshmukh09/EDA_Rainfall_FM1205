## 📊 EDA Steps Summary
1. **Data Loading** — Imported rainfall dataset into Pandas DataFrame  
2. **Data Inspection** — Checked shape, info, and missing values  
3. **Data Cleaning** — Handled missing values and verified data integrity  
4. **Descriptive Statistics** — Computed mean, median, variance, skewness, and kurtosis  
5. **Data Visualization** — Created correlation heatmap, pair plots, and trend analysis  
6. **Insights & Interpretation** — Derived key findings for rainfall trends

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain months (e.g., June–September) show high rainfall variance across years.  
- Positive correlations observed between monsoon months (JJAS).  
- Some subdivisions experience extreme rainfall variability, hinting at potential anomalies.  
- Annual rainfall follows cyclical patterns with occasional deviations due to climatic factors.

## 🧩 Future Scope
- Build predictive models using regression or time-series forecasting.  
- Integrate real-time rainfall APIs for dynamic analysis.  
- Add geographical visualization using GeoPandas or Plotly.
